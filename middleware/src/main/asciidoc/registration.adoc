This endpoint helps an expertise/scholar to create his/her profile using this system.

=== Submit

User is required to enter first name, last name and an email address to submit the registration form.
This creates a new token and an email, using the email address provided in the registraion form, is sent to the user. A new user object is then created with a specific role assigned.

=== Confirm

This endpoint requires a key string, (obtained when the user clicks on the email confirmation link) which verifies the user token.
This key string constructs a token by obtaining user-specified extended information associated with the token, when it was first created.
If the user is found and the token is not expired, a user object (as shown in "Sample Response") is returned.
